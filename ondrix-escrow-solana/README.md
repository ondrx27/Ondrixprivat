- ✅ **Full security audit completed**
- ✅ **All attack vectors tested and blocked**
- ✅ **PDA lamport transfer issue resolved**
- ✅ **Reentrancy protection implemented**
- ✅ **Investment limits enforced**

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔧 Smart Contracts
- `src/lib.rs` - **V4 Global Timer Contract** (PRODUCTION)
- `src-v3-individual-timers/lib.rs` - **V3 Individual Timer Contract** (BACKUP)

### 🧪 Security Tests
- `tests-archive/v4-global-timer/`
  - `full-cycle-test.js` - Complete escrow lifecycle test
  - `security-test.js` - **Multi-vector security validation**
  - `test-claim.js` - SOL withdrawal functionality test

- `tests-archive/v3-individual-timers/`
  - `v3-full-lifecycle.js` - V3 complete test
  - `v3-lifecycle-test.js` - V3 individual timer test

### 📦 Utilities
- `dist/tests/utils.js` - **V4 instruction builders (PRODUCTION)**
- `tests-v3-individual-timers/utils.ts` - V3 instruction builders

## 🛡️ Security Validated

### Attacks Tested & Blocked:
1. **✅ Cross-investor theft** - Investor2 cannot steal SOL from Investor1
2. **✅ SOL redirect attacks** - SOL can only go to designated recipient
3. **✅ Random user attacks** - Unauthorized users cannot access funds
4. **✅ Double withdrawal** - Prevents multiple withdrawals of same funds
5. **✅ Early withdrawal** - Time locks properly enforced

### Critical Fixes Applied:
- **🔧 PDA Lamport Transfer** - Direct lamport manipulation instead of system_instruction::transfer
- **🔧 Authorization** - Both initializer AND recipient can withdraw
- **🔧 Writable Accounts** - Correct isWritable flags for all accounts
- **🔧 Owner Validation** - PDA ownership verified before operations

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Initialize Escrow** - Create global escrow with 2-minute lock timer
2. **Deposit SOL** - Investors deposit SOL, receive tokens immediately
3. **SOL Split** - 50% goes to recipient instantly, 50% locked in individual vaults
4. **Wait Period** - Locked SOL cannot be withdrawn until timer expires
5. **Withdraw** - After timer, locked SOL can be claimed by recipient
